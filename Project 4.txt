Late Policy:  -10 points per hour late

Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  All work should be your own.



Objective:

     Implement an external sort routine.


Description:

     Create a class called ExternalSort.

     Your class should have the following methods.  You may add additional methods as needed.

     You may use code from the textbook, but all other code must be your own.

   a) public static Path extsort(Path t1, int runsize)

          Uses the external sort procedure illustrated in chapter 7 to sort the file represented 
          by Path t1 using the passed size as the run size and returns a Path to the sorted result.

          For the tapes, use files named T1-T4.  The data should already be on T1 when this method 
          is called.  You can assume the data consists of Integers.

          Your sort should work even if the number of input items is not a multiple of the run size.
         
          Note that "Path" is an object in Java's "java.nio.file" package.



   20 points
   b) public static void main(String args[])

          Accepts run size as a command line argument.
          Assumes input already exists on a file named T1.
          Calls the external sort routine.
          Prints the Path object which gives the path to the sorted file.
